    text: `"Great indeed are your works O' Lord, now and forever more". This song of joy echoes in our ears as we come
to the campus of St. Teresa's Primary Teachers Education College, Bettiah. From a very small tiny seed that
was sown in the year 1947, today it has grown big tree sheltering common flocks of people of the area. I
wouldn't go wrong to say that the inception of the college goes together with the independence of our Nation.
At one side our country got her freedom back from the hands of the British rules and on the other hand the
women folk of the area got freedom to come out from their homes for greater learning. I feel extremely
privileged to come from Bettiah Where Capuchin Fathers sowed the seed of faith, Jesuits and the Holy Cross
Congregation have given us education. It was not just as education but was life transforming. They have
changed everything in our lives. The education that is given at St. Teresa's Primary Teachers Education College
is far better than any other reputed colleges and institutions. The teachers are professionally equipped to
develop, adapt and modify curriculum, content, pedagogy and assessment which suit the needs and
aspirations of would-be teachers. They work towards a holistic, experiential, integrated, students-centered
educational system that helps to improve the creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving skills of our
young learners to equip them for the ever-changing world. Holy Cross Sisters have done tremendous work in
changing the society, especially women in their various capacities. The brightest example is St. Teresa's
Primary Teachers Education College. I congratulate the management, dedicated teachers and future nations
builders of the college.`
